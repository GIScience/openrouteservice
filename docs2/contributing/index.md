# Contributing
When people contribute to openrouteservice, it makes [the whole
team](https://heigit.org/heigit-team/) do a little happy dance!  There are many
ways that you can contribute to make openrouteservice a better routing service.
Whether you are a Java developer who is interested in fixing some bugs or
adding some new functionality, someone who knows an area well and can update
information in OSM so that openrouteservice can take it into account, or even
someone who speaks different languages and is will to provide some translations
for routing instructions, there will be something that you can help with.

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/issues) and label it accordingly. If your issue regards the openrouteservice web-app
please use the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/GIScience/ors-maps-client/issues).
