# Running JAR / WAR

## Provided artifacts

For release version 8.0.0 and newer, we provide JAR and WAR files as artifacts for download. The JAR file can be run stand-alone and will start openrouteservice using a built-in tomcat server. Alternatively, you can set up your own tomcat instance on your server and deploy the WAR artifact on it.
