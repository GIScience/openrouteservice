# Installation

There are multiple possible ways to run your own openrouteservice instance. You can either run openrouteservice stand-alone by running the JAR file, or use the WAR file within an [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) installation. Alternatively, you can use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or [podman](https://podman.io/) or [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/)) to run openrouteservice within a container. If you want to customize your instance further than what is possible already by configuration, you can also locally build from source. For further instructions refer to the following documents:

* [Running JAR / WAR](running-jar-war)
* [Running in a container](running-in-container)
* [Building from Source](building-from-source)

For more information on configuring openrouteservice for your specific needs, also see the [configuration](configuration/) documentation.
