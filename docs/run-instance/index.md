# Running your own openrouteservice instance

If you need to customize the behavior of openrouteservice or if the features or quota provided by our public API is not
sufficient for your needs, you can run your own openrouteservice instance on a server or your local computer. In an own
instance, you can activate all endpoints, also those that are not available in our public API.

There are different options to achieve this. The service can be built in the form of different artifact types: **WAR**,
**JAR** or as **Docker Image**. In the first column of the table below you find a link to some basic information about
each artifact type.

No matter how you want to run your openrouteservice, you first need the corresponding artifact. The second and third
columns link to detail information about how to build a customized version yourself or where you can download the
artifact.

For configuration, operation and troubleshooting it plays no role, if you run a downloaded or customized version (as
long as you don't change basic things like configuration). You find links to information about these topics in the three
right columns.

But before you start operating your own openrouteservice in the technical way of your choice, please read the
documentation regarding [System Requirements](system-requirements) and [Data](data)!

::: tip
We recommend to use the docker option for simplicity, or plain JAR if you do not want to install Docker.

## Checking

By default, the service status can be queried via the [health endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/health/index.md).

```shell 
curl 'http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/health'
# should result in an output like 
# {"status":"ready"}
```

When the service is ready, you will be able to request the [status endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/status/index.md)
for further information on the running services.

```shell 
curl 'http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/status'
# should result in an output like 
# {"languages":["cs","cs-cz","de","de-de","en","en-us","eo","eo-eo","es","es-es","fr","fr-fr","gr","gr-gr","he","he-il","hu","hu-hu","id","id-id","it","it-it","ja","ja-jp","ne","ne-np","nl","nl-nl","pl","pl-pl","pt","pt-pt","ro","ro-ro","ru","ru-ru","tr","tr-tr","zh","zh-cn"],"engine":{"build_date":"2024-01-02T16:34:45Z","version":"8.0"},"profiles":{"profile 1":{"storages":{"WayCategory":{"gh_profile":"car_ors_fastest_with_turn_costs"},"HeavyVehicle":{"gh_profile":"car_ors_fastest_with_turn_costs"},"WaySurfaceType":{"gh_profile":"car_ors_fastest_with_turn_costs"},"RoadAccessRestrictions":{"gh_profile":"car_ors_fastest_with_turn_costs","use_for_warnings":"true"}},"profiles":"driving-car","creation_date":"","limits":{"maximum_distance":100000,"maximum_waypoints":50,"maximum_distance_dynamic_weights":100000,"maximum_distance_avoid_areas":100000}}},"services":["routing","isochrones","matrix","snap"]}
```

If you use the default dataset you will be able to request something like the following route request to the car profile
in Heidelberg.

```shell 
curl 'http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/directions/driving-car?start=8.681495,49.41461&end=8.687872,49.420318'
```


## Instance infrastructure

Though having a single instance of openrouteservice works great for smaller datasets or when the graph data doesn't need updating, in many
real world implementations having just the one instance isn't the most suitable solution. If you have one instance,
then all building and serving of routes happens through that single instance, meaning that when you rebuild graphs, you
can't make any requests to that instance for things like directions as there are no complete graphs that can be used to
generate routes with. If it is important that you have graph updates from new data whilst ensuring that there is a
minimal amount of time during which users cannot make requests, we would recommend having two instances - one that is
permanently active for serving requests, and one that gets fired up to rebuild graphs.

In that setup, when graphs have been built you can simply stop the container serving requests, replace the graphs used (
they are mapped to a folder on the host machine which is defined in the `docker-compose` file), and then restart the
"request" instance. The new graphs will be reloaded into memory (the amount of time needed for this depends on the size of the
graphs and the type of hard drive) and then ready to use for routing. The downtime from reloading already built graphs
is normally far less than the time needed to build the graphs. A thing to note though is that you should ensure that the
config files and the amount of RAM allocated (as described earlier) is the same on both the builder and the request
server else the newly built graphs may not load. **Also, ensure that `REBUILD_GRAPHS` parameter used by the request serving container 
is set to false else it will try to build the graphs for itself!**
