# Installation

There are multiple possible ways to run your own openrouteservice instance. The most convenient way is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run openrouteservice within a container, with a hosted Docker image or building from source. Alternatively, you can either run openrouteservice stand-alone by running the JAR file, or use the WAR file within an [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) installation. If you want to customize your instance further than what is possible already by configuration, you can also locally build from source. For further instructions refer to the following documents:

* [Running with Docker](running-with-docker)
* [Running JAR / WAR](running-jar-war)
* [Building from Source](building-from-source)

For more information on configuring openrouteservice for your specific needs, also see the [configuration](../configuration/) documentation.
