# Configuration

openrouteservice has plenty of configuration properties.
This makes openrouteservice a very customizable software.
Chapter [What to configure](what-to-configure.md)
gives you an entry point to all configuration properties of openrouteservice
and also shows you
a [minimal configuration example](what-to-configure.md#minimal-configuration).

There are different ways to set configuration properties.
This again gives you flexibility in the way you run openrouteservice.
But it is crucial to know and understand the different configuration mechanisms
in order to operate the openrouteservice with the desired configuration.
In Chapter [How to configure](how-to-configure.md)
we handle the different dimensions of the configuration topic.
