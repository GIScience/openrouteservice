# Openrouteservice native setup examples

We already provide instructions on how to set up and use openroutservice.
However, the following examples are more specific to certain environments and are targeted at users who are
looking for a more complete setup guide.
The scope is broader from setting up dependencies to deploying the service.

If you are an advanced user, have a look at the existing setup instructions:

- [Running openrouteservice with Docker](/run-instance/running-with-docker.md)
- [Running openrouteservice as JAR](/run-instance/running-jar.md)
- [Running openrouteservice as WAR](/run-instance/running-war.md)

::: tip
The examples are growing over time and only provide a small subset of possible setups. \
If you are missing specific detailed     setup instruction, **you are welcome to contribute** by creating a pull request.
