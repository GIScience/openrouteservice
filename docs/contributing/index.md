# Contributing

We are glad that you decided to contribute to the openrouteservice.

There are plenty of ways to help make it an even better routing service.
Whether you are a Java developer who is interested in fixing
some bugs or adding some new functionality, someone who knows an area well and
can update information in OSM so that openrouteservice can take it into
account, or even someone who speaks different languages and is will to provide
some translations for routing instructions, there will be something that you
can help with.

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/issues) and label it accordingly.
If your issue regards the openrouteservice maps client on [maps.openrouteservice.org](https://maps.openrouteservice.org)
please use the [corresponding repository](https://github.com/GIScience/ors-map-client/issues).
