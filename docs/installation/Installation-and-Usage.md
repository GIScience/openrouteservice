# Installation and Usage

## Installation via Docker

We suggest using docker to install and launch openrouteservice backend. In short, run the following commands will get
everything done.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/master/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```

This will pull the latest release version of openrouteservice from dockerhub and start it up using an example setup and
the provided test OSM file.
You can also modify the configuration and source file settings to match your needs. For more details, check
the [Running with Docker](Running-with-Docker)-Section.
More explanation about customization can be found in the [Advanced Docker Setup](Advanced-Docker-Setup)

## Installation of `openrouteservice-jws5` via RPM Package for Enterprise Linux Environments

The following explanation will guide you through the installation of the `openrouteservice-jws5` package
on `RHEL 8.x` with `OpenJDK 17 headless` and `JBoss Web Server 5.x` for `ors version 7.2.x`.



### Prerequisites

#### Installation via RedHat jws5 subscription

Install the following packages via dnf with a valid RedHat subscription for jws5:

```bash
dnf groupinstall jws5
dnf install -y java-17-openjdk-headless
```

#### Set environment variables

For the installation, the variable `ORS_HOME` showing the persistence directory of the OpenRouteService needs to be set, e.g.

```bash
echo "ORS_HOME=/opt/openrouteservice" >> /etc/environment
```    

**Only if** JBoss Web Service was installed _in a different way_ than described above, some paths need to be specified additionally:

```bash
echo "JWS_CONF_FOLDER=<your custom path>" >> /etc/environment
echo "JWS_WEBAPPS_FOLDER=<your custom path>" >> /etc/environment
```

#### Yum .repo Configuration

To access and install `openrouteservice` via RPM packages from our repository, set up the following .repo file
within `/etc/yum.repos.d/`:

> /etc/yum.repos.d/ors.repo

```bash
[openrouteservice-rpm-snapshots]
name=openrouteservice RPM repository
baseurl=https://test-repo.openrouteservice.org/repository/openrouteservice-rpm/snapshots/openrouteservice-jws
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/825F57B756C0B5851C398478585E8FA82AFB5B55

# The releases repository is not yet available
#[openrouteservice-rpm-releases]
#name=openrouteservice RPM repository
#baseurl=https://test-repo.openrouteservice.org/repository/openrouteservice-rpm/realeases/openrouteservice-jws
#enabled=1
#gpgcheck=1
#gpgkey=https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/825F57B756C0B5851C398478585E8FA82AFB5B55
```

This repository includes two channels: `snapshots` and `releases`.
The `snapshots channel` contains the latest snapshot builds of the `openrouteservice-jws5` package,
while the `releases channel` holds the latest release builds (though it is not yet operational).

After adding the repository, update dnf:

```bash
dnf update
```

### Installation

Now you can install the openrouteservice itself using the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf clean all && sudo dnf check-update && sudo dnf install -y openrouteservice-jws5
```

**Default openrouteservice User and Group**

The installation of `openrouteservice-jws5` establishes a `new openrouteservice user and group`.
This `non-root`, `nologin` user is employed to securely manage RPM package files and directories during installation,
upgrading, and removal of openrouteservice-jws5 packages.

The `tomcat` user `is assigned membership` within the openrouteservice group,
granting them access to manipulate files and folders within `ORS_HOME` and its subdirectories.

Upon each execution of the openrouteservice-jws5 package's update routine, file and folder permissions
within `ORS_HOME` are realigned to the openrouteservice user and group.

This collaborative group setup prevents interference between the tomcat user permissions during installation,
ensuring a smooth process.


---
**Default folder structure**

Upon installation, `openrouteservice-jws5` generates the `ORS_HOME` working directory, which houses the
subsequent subfolders (initially empty unless manually created):

```bash
/opt/openrouteservice/
├── .elevation-cache # Contains the elevation data cache
├── config # Should contain the configuration file
├── files # Should contain the osm.pbf source files
├── .graphs # Contains the graph files when build
└── logs # Contains the log files
```

---
**Configuration**

For proper operation, the `openrouteservice-jws5` installation `necessitates` the presence of the `ors-config.json`
configuration file within the `$ORS_HOME/config` directory.
This configuration file effectively configures the openrouteservice backend.

Upon installation, a sample configuration file (`config-example.json`) can be located `within`
the `$ORS_HOME/config` directory.

---
**Example Usage**

The following usage example showcases the execution of OpenRouteService with the recently
installed `openrouteservice-jws5` package:

```bash
# Obtain a OSM file using curl
curl https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/andorra-latest.osm.pbf -o /opt/openrouteservice/files/osm-file.osm.pbf
# Utilize the default configuration file
cp /opt/openrouteservice/config/config-example.json /opt/openrouteservice/config/ors-config.json
# Restart the tomcat server and await graph construction
# Check the endpoint ors/v2/status, which should display "ready" once graph construction is complete.
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ors/v2/status
```

## Usage

Openrouteservice offers a set of endpoints for different spatial purposes. They are served with the help
of [Tomcat in a java servlet container](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/blob/master/ors-api/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml).
By default you will be able to query the services with these addresses:

- `http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/directions`
- `http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/isochrones`
- `http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/matrix`

Note, that Tomcat running via maven will use port `8082` by default.
