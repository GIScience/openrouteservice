# Building from Source
{: .no_toc }

**We recommend running openrouteservice using a Docker container (see [Running with Docker](Running-with-Docker))**

## Installation from source

If you need to install without Docker, on an Ubuntu 20.04 system (also generally works with newer Ubuntu versions) you can use the following steps:

  1. (Fork and) Clone the openrouteservice repository to your machine.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/user/openrouteservice.git
      cd openrouteservice
      ```

  2. Make sure that you have java 1.11 set as the default Java environment.
  3. Make sure that you have Maven installed.
  4. Download/create an OpenStreetMap pbf file on the machine.
  5. Copy the `openrouteservice/src/main/resources/ors-config-sample.json` file to
     the same location but renaming it to `ors-config.json`.  For testing, use the
     `openrouteservice-api-tests/conf/ors-config-test.json`-file.
  6. Update the `ors-config.json` file to reflect the various settings, profiles you
     want to have running, and the locations of various files, in particular
     the source location of the OSM file that will be used and additional files
     required for extended storages. You should make sure that these folders/files
     are accessible by the service, for example by using the `sudo chmod -R 777
     [path to folder]` command.
     An explanation of the file format and parameters can be found [here](Configuration)
  7. From within the `openrouteservice` folder (containing the pom file and the
     src folder, amongst others) run the command `mvn package`. This will build
     the openrouteservice ready for tomcat deployment.

After you have packaged openrouteservice, there are two options for running it.
One is to run the `mvn tomcat7:run` command which triggers a self contained
Tomcat instance running on port `8082`.  This is more restrictive in terms of
settings for Tomcat. The other is to install and run Tomcat 8 

## Running from within IDE

To run the project from within your IDE, you have to:

  1. Set up your IDE project and import `openrouteservice` and
     `openrouteservice-api-tests` modules as Maven model.
     For IntelliJ Idea, have a look at [these instructions](Opening-Project-in-IntelliJ).

  2. Configure your IDE to run `tomcat7:run-war` as the maven goal, setting the
     environment variable `ORS_CONIFG=ors-config-test.json`.

  3. You can run API tests via JUnit.

## Installing and running tomcat8

  1. Install Tomcat 8 using `sudo apt-get install tomcat8`.

     Note that it might not be available in the lastest repositories of your distribution anymore.
     In that case, add the following line(s) to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:
     ```
     debian:  deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ stretch main
              deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main

     ubuntu:  deb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main universe
              deb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security main universe
     ```
     For more details, visit [the debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) on the `sources.list`-format.

  2. If you want to use system settings (i.e. Java heap size) other than the
     default, then you need to add these to the
     `/usr/share/tomcat8/bin/setenv.sh` file. If the file is not present, then you
     can create it. The settings generally used on our servers are similar to:

     ```bash
     JAVA_OPTS="-server -XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=75 -XX:SurvivorRatio=64 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=3 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -Xms105g -Xmx105g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=50m"
     CATALINA_OPTS="(here we set settings for JMX monitoring)"
     ```

  3. If you add these new settings to the `setenv.sh` file, then you need to
     restart Tomcat for these to take effect using `sudo systemctl restart
     tomcat8.service`.
  4. To get openrouteservice up and running, copy the `ors.war` file found in
     the `openrouteservice/target` folder to the Tomcat webapps folder. For
     example

     ```bash
     sudo cp ~/openrouteservice/openroutesrvice/target/ors.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/
     ```

  5. Tomcat should now automatically detect the new WAR file and deploy the
     service. Depending on profiles and size of the OSM data, this can take
     some time until openrouteservice has built graphs and is ready for generating
     routes. You can check if it is ready by accessing
     `http://localhost:8080/ors/health` (the port and URL may be different if you
     have installed Tomcat differently than above). If you get a `status: ready`
     message, you are good to go in creating routes.

There are numerous settings within the `ors-config.json` which are highly dependent
on your individual circumstances, but many of these [are documented](Configuration). As a guide
however you can look at the `ors-config-sample.json` file in the
`openrouteservice/src/main/resources` folder. If you run into issues relating
to out of memory or similar, then you will need to adjust java/tomcat settings
accordingly.

## Integrating GraphHopper

If you need to make adjustments to our forked and edited [GraphHopper
repository](https://github.com/GIScience/graphhopper), follow these steps:

1. Clone and checkout `ors_0.13.2`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GIScience/graphhopper.git
   cd graphhopper
   git checkout ors_0.13.2
   ```

2. Build the project to create the local snapshot.

3. Change the `openrouteservice/pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <!--
   <dependency>
   <groupId>com.github.GIScience.graphhopper</groupId>
   <artifactId>graphhopper-core</artifactId>
       <version>v0.9.12</version>
   </dependency>
   
   <dependency>
   <groupId>com.github.GIScience.graphhopper</groupId>
   <artifactId>graphhopper-reader-osm</artifactId>
   <version>v0.9.12</version>
   </dependency>
   -->
   
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
       <artifactId>graphhopper-core</artifactId>
       <version>0.13-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
       <artifactId>graphhopper-reader-osm</artifactId>
       <version>0.13-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

4. Test your new functionality and run `openrouteservice-api-tests` after
   rebasing your feature branch with the latest `development` branch. Adjust
   tests if necessary

5. If successful, create a PR for both
   [openrouteservice](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/pulls) and
   [GraphHopper](https://github.com/GIScience/graphhopper/pulls) against `master`
   and `ors_0.13.2` branches, respectively.

**Note that in these examples, the 0.13_2 version of GH is used - you should
update which you use accordingly. To know which to use, check the
[openrouteservice pom file](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/pom.xml) 
and see what version is being used for the `com.github.GIScience.graphhopper`
dependencies**
