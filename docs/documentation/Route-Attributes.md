Route attributes can be used to attribute every segment of a route with possibly three values:

## AvgSpeed

This value is in _km/h_ and equals the average speed for this way segment after grading and applying factors.

## Detourfactor

This value is a _factor_ and gives the relative length of the segment with
regard to the length of the beeline between the start and end point of the
route segment.

## Percentage

This value is in _percent_ and gives the segment length in terms of the route
length.
