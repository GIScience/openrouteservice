# Status Endpoint

:::warning NOTE
This endpoint is not available in the public API, but you can use it when running an own instance of openrouteservice.
:::

The GET request http://localhost:8082/ors/v2/status (host and port are dependent on the setup) returns basic information about the running instance:

* `languages`: Available languages
* `engine`:
    * `version`: Release version of the running openrouteservice
    * `build_date`: Build date of the running openrouteservice
    * `graph_version` Version of the graph structure and build logic. This parameter is part of the software and cannot
      be configured. Graphs with the same `graph_version` are compatible, e.g. openrouteservice version Y can load
      graphs that were built with an older version X, if both versions have the same `graph_version`. The parameter is
      also used to find a graph in a graph repository,
      if [graph management](/run-instance/configuration/engine/graph-management.md) is enabled.
* `profiles`: Available (enabled) routing profiles.
  The profile names correspond to the keys in the configuration beneath `ors.engine.profiles`.   
  The profile names are used as path parameters in API requests and as directory names for the graph directories.
  Some basic information is shown for each profile:
    * `encoder_name`: The vehicle type
    * `osm_date`: Timestamp of the osm pbf file that was used for building the graph. This is usually the date of the
      latest included change.
    * `graph_build_date`: The date, when graph building was started for this routing profile.
    * `storages`: configured storages
    * `limits`: configured limits
* `services`: Activated services. The endpoints `status` and `health` are not included here.
