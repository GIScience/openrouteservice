# Directions Service

The Directions Service calculates routes and directions between two or more locations for different modes of transportation. 

A complete and concise overview of all request parameters and return types can be found in the [API Playground](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/directions_service).
Here, however, a few topics are explained in more detail:

* The different directions aka routing [requests and return types](requests-and-return-types.md)
* How advanced [Routing Options](routing-options.md) can be defined
* How [Extra Info](extra-info/index.md) like road surface, track type, OpenStreetMap way ID or additional [Route Attributes](route-attributes.md) can be requested
* How geometries in directions responses can be [decoded](geometry-decoding.md)
* How [Instruction Types](instruction-types.md) are encoded in the directions response
