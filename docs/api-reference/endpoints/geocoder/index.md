# Geocoder Endpoint

The Geocoder Endpoint of our public API is served by a [Pelias](https://www.pelias.io) instance.
It resolves geo coordinates to addresses and vice versa.

Check our [API interactive examples](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/geocode) to see 
which pelias endpoints are available through our public API.
For more insights, please refer to the [Pelias Documentation](https://github.com/pelias/documentation),
additional info about the [structured geocoding query](structured-geocoding-query.md) and [geocoding responses](geocoding-response.md).
