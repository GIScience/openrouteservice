# Optimization Service

Our public API includes an instance of VROOM, an open-source optimization engine written in C++20 that aim at providing 
good solutions to various real-life vehicle routing problems (VRP) within a small computing time.

Details on how to use it can be found in our [interactive API examples](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/optimization).

If you need deeper insights or want to run your own instance, please visit the Github project [vroom](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom).
