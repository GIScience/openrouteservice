## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Enable OSM "key:access" tag values to take effect for heavy vehicle profile (Issue #209)

- Added unit conversion so that isochrone response is in user specified unit (issue #91)
- Enabled the reporting of multiple missing points in error response (issue #246)
- Fixed wrong bounding box error (Issue #241)
- Fixed problem with mountain bike profile never using contraction hierarchies.

### Changed
- Updated the internal graphhopper libraries from 0.9.x to 0.10.1 and reduced the number of custom implementations and features.
This implies that some of the previous features is no longer available in this release of openrouteservice. Most of these
adjustments are under the hood and will not be noticeable for anyone. Have said that there is of course **one exception**:
You need to create a separate profile per vehicle. In previous versions it was possible to combine multiple vehicles (like
bike, road bike, e-bike and mtb) into a single ors-profile - this is no longer possible. Instead you need to create one
profile for bike, one for mtb one for road bike and so on.  
- Updated/refactored road bike flagencoder to make it more suitable for road cycling enthusiasts. Please note, that the
generated routs might not be compliant to the local regulations - specially when 'Biking trails are obligated to be use'
- Refactored some of the edge filters and cleaned up the code initializing them
- Updated the wheelchair profile to better handle restrictions such as width, kerb heights and instances where sidewalks
are attached to roads. (Issue #162)
- Replaced "Sand" surface encoding with "Paving stone"
- Changed the bbox api test (Issue #241)
- Changed the way the bbox is calculated internally (Issue #241)
- Change the license from apache 2.0 to LGPL3 (PR #296)
