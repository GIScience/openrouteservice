  # ----------------- ORS application configuration ------------------- #
  ors-app:
    # Activate the following lines to build the container from the repository
    # You have to add --build to the docker compose command to do so
    build:
      context: ./
    container_name: ors-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8082"  # Expose the ORS API on port 8080
      - "9001:9001"  # Expose additional port for monitoring (optional)
    image: openrouteservice/openrouteservice:nightly
    #user: "0:0"  # Set the user and group to 0 to avoid permission issues. Advanced option!
    volumes:  # Mount relative directories. ONLY for local container runtime. To switch to docker managed volumes see 'Docker Volumes configuration' section below.
      - ./graphs:/home/ors/graphs  # Mount graphs directory
      - ./elevation_cache:/home/ors/elevation_cache  # Mount elevation cache directory
      - ./config:/home/ors/config  # Mount configuration directory
      - ./logs:/home/ors/logs  # Mount logs directory
      - ./files:/home/ors/files  # Mount files directory
    environment:
      REBUILD_GRAPHS: False  # Set to True to rebuild graphs on container start.
      CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL: INFO  # Log level for the container. Possible values: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
      ORS_CONFIG_LOCATION: /home/ors/config/example-ors-config.yml  # Location of the default ORS example configuration file in the docker container
      # This config file will be reverted at each container start. If you want to use your own configuration file, create a copy in the container and rename this variable.

      # ------------------ JAVA OPTS ------------------ #
      # Configure the memory settings for JAVA or pass additional opts
      # Fore more available ENV properties see Prepare CATALINA_OPTS and JAVA_OPTS
      # in https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/blob/main/docker-entrypoint.sh
      XMS: 1g  # start RAM assigned to java
      XMX: 2g  # max RAM assigned to java. Rule of Thumb: <PBF-size> * <profiles> * 2
      # Example: 1.5 GB pbf size, two profiles (car and foot-walking)
      # -> 1.5 * 2 * 2 = 6. Set xmx to be AT LEAST `-Xmx6g`
      ADDITIONAL_JAVA_OPTS: ""  # further options you want to pass to the java command

      # ----------------- Properties configuration ------------------- #
      # Configure your whole container with only property ENVs.
      # These can be set alternatively or additionally to the yml configuration file.
      # Note, that any values set will override the corresponding values from the yml configuration file.
      # See the ors-config.env file for more options.
      # To have a configuration file-less container, uncomment at least the following properties.
      # The values are examples and provide the default configuration.
      #ors.engine.source_file: /home/ors/files/example-heidelberg.osm.gz
      #ors.engine.graphs_root_path: /home/ors/graphs
      #ors.engine.elevation.cache_path: /home/ors/elevation_cache
      #ors.engine.profiles.car.enabled: true

    # ----------------- ENV file configuration ------------------- #
    # Too many variables for your 'environment:' section?
    # Use an env_file with the ENV properties instead and define everything in there:
    # Values will be overwritten if set in the 'environment' section.
    #env_file: ors-config.env

    # ----------------- Healthcheck configuration ------------------- #
    # The healthcheck is disabled by default. Uncomment the following lines to enable it.
    # The healthcheck allows you to monitor the status of the ORS application.
    # Be careful with long graph builds, as the healthcheck will fail and show 'unhealthy' during this time.
    # This is especially useful if you run your ORS container in a production environment.
    #healthcheck:
    #  test: curl --fail http://localhost:8080/ors/v2/health || exit 1
    #  start_period: 1m
    #  interval: 10s
    #  timeout: 2s
    #  retries: 3
    #  disable: false

# ----------------- Docker Volumes configuration ------------------- #
# Define the Docker managed volumes for the ORS application. For more info on Docker Volumes see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/07-volumes/
# Volumes are used to persist the data and configuration of the ORS application.
# If you want to use volumes, uncomment the following lines and remove the ./ prefix from the volume paths in 'services.ors-app.volumes'.
#volumes:
#    graphs:
#    elevation_cache:
#    config:
#    logs:
#    files:
